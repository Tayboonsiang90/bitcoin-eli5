Bitcoin Explained Like I’m Five (ELI5)

# Summary
This is an educational website meant to spread blockchain awareness (without dishing out financial advice). It focuses on Bitcoin as the most common example of a blockchain. 
# Context and Justification
Many people fear cryptocurrencies, even Charlie Munger of Berkshire says “Bitcoin Nearly as Bad as ‘Trading Harvested Baby Brains’”. Yet, the blockchain industry aka Web 3.0 has now grown to a $2 trillion industry in 2022 despite all the negative press.

Blockchain is often likened to the internet - at inception, many people made famous incorrect predictions about the role that the Internet would play in our lives. Even Robert Metcalfe, who invented Ethernet, predicted that the Internet will collapse one day. These negative, fear-mongering statements often lead to misconceptions in society about the nature of cryptocurrencies. 

For new entrants, the first thing when they google Bitcoin is “Bitcoin is a digital, peer-to-peer decentralized currency that can be exchanged without intermediaries”. This statement is often unhelpful and off-putting for people just wanting to read up a little more to broaden their knowledge. 

This project aims to dispel some of the myths surrounding cryptocurrencies, and generally, blockchains and delves into the technical aspect of how they work - with data visualization.
