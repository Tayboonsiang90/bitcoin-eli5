# Summary
### Project One-Liner 
This is an educational website meant to spread blockchain awareness (without dishing out financial advice). It focuses on Bitcoin as the most common example of a blockchain. 
### Context and Justification
Many people fear cryptocurrencies, even Charlie Munger of Berkshire says 
>“Bitcoin Nearly as Bad as ‘Trading Harvested Baby Brains’”. 

Yet, the blockchain industry aka Web 3.0 has now grown to a $2 trillion industry in 2022 despite all the negative press.

Blockchain is often likened to the internet - at inception, many people made famous incorrect predictions about the role that the Internet would play in our lives. Even Robert Metcalfe, who invented Ethernet, predicted that the Internet will collapse one day. These negative, fear-mongering statements often lead to misconceptions in society about the nature of cryptocurrencies. 

For new entrants, the first thing when they google Bitcoin is “Bitcoin is a digital, peer-to-peer decentralized currency that can be exchanged without intermediaries”. This statement is often unhelpful and off-putting for people just wanting to read up a little more to broaden their knowledge. 

This project aims to dispel some of the myths surrounding cryptocurrencies, and generally, blockchains and delves into the technical aspect of how they work - with data visualization.

# 5 Planes of Design 
## Target audience group:
### Non-Technical people with no blockchain knowledge but are curious
**Age:** 16 onwards 

**Occupation:** Students, Working Adults from all walks of life

**Educational Level:** Secondary to Tertiary

**IT Literacy Level:** Able to use computers with varying proficiency

**Goals:** 
Want to learn how to make money off blockchain
Specifically, they want to know what are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies
Want to know how to use the blockchain

**Considerations:**
No exposure to blockchain jargon from the get-go, need to ease them slowly. 
Learning pedagogy needs to be simple and plenty of examples.
Give them insights about how to make money off cryptocurrencies

### Non-Technical people with basic blockchain knowledge and want to learn more
**Age:** 16 onwards 

**Occupation:** Investors, Traders, Speculators, Finance Industry

**Educational Level:** Secondary to Tertiary

**IT Literacy Level:** Able to use computers with varying proficiency

**Goals:**
Want to learn something new that they don’t know prior

**Considerations:**
Should allow them to learn something new despite their prior blockchain knowledge
Delve into more esoteric topics that they probably have not heard of about blockchains (Like AMMs, DeFi)

### Technical people
**Age:** 16 onwards 

**Occupation:** STEM Occupations

**Educational Level:** Tertiary

**IT Literacy Level:** Proficient at computers and familiar with computing concepts

**Goals:** 
Want to know the more technical aspects of blockchain

**Considerations:**  
Information presented needs to be technically accurate
Can handle more complex concepts which will give them better understanding

## UI/UX:
### User Stories
- As a working (in a non-technical field) adult with little time and no prior knowledge about cryptocurrencies, I want to learn more about them so that I can decide whether to invest in them.
Acceptance Criteria
Quick and succinct in knowledge delivery
Non-technical, gentle introduction of jargon

- As an adult who has heard much negative news about cryptocurrencies but didn’t do any prior read-up, I want to open my mind once again to them so that I understand why some of my friends are so upbeat about cryptocurrencies. 
Acceptance Criteria
Dispel negative myths in a transparent manner
Non-biased delivery of information
Non pushy narrative

- As an adult who has already bought cryptocurrencies, I think I know plenty about cryptocurrencies. I want to see if there is anything more I can learn so that I can broaden my knowledge
Acceptance Criteria
Delving into technical aspects which most people rarely touch
Delving into more exotic topics

### Special considerations:
Due to the jurisdiction in which the website is created in, there should be no financial advice whatsoever. 
## Content:

### Webpages

- Index Page
- History
- Security
- Scarcity
- Decentralization
- Dashboard

### Wireframe
